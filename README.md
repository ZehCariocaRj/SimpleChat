This is simple chat server and client that I'm writing to practice my Java, C#, WPF, Android, and iOS coding.  
  
The base server was generated using Swagger, and output to Java JAX-RS (Jersey 1.18.1).  
  
#Planned
###C# + WPF Windows client

The WPF client has mostly been implemented. It supports chat rooms, inviting users to chat rooms, renaming chatrooms, and changing your profile information (username, display name, password, and email).  
Things that are not implemented but could reasonable added if needed: kicking someone from chatroom, removing yourself from chatroom.  
Known bugs: Main chat list does not update.

This is not meant to be used seriously and is only a programming exercise.
